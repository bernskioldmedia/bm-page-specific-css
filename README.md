# BM: Page Specific CSS
Adds a Gutenberg panel where you can add specific page-specific CSS.
This is then saved into files, minified and included only only on the very specific page it is created for.

## Custom Post Types
In order to use this plugin on custom post type, the post type must have the 'custom-fields' support.

## Coding Style
We exclusively try and use the WordPress coding practices for all languages,
which includes PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This base plugin is in part OOP based to both live in its own namespace,
and to make extending, updating and maintaining code simple and easy.

## Open Source
The reason we are open sourcing it is because it's the right thing to do.
Perhaps someone finds a use out of it all, or parts. This is not going to be
an actively developed "master plugin base" that is set out to be the next
greatest thing in the WordPress community. It's just going to be what
we use internally, just published for the world to see and use as you see fit.
